Purpose:
This tool helps researchers analyze and save insights from their academic abstracts, focusing on readability, keyword relevance, and research topic classification.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. User Information Input
You’ll be prompted to provide the following:

	Full Name (e.g., Oluwatosin Lazarus)

	Research Topic (e.g., Effects of Air Pollution on Lung Health)

	Research Abstract (Paste full abstract text)

Note: Once submitted, the information cannot be edited again, so please review it carefully before confirming.

2. Abstract Analysis
The tool automatically performs:

	Discipline Classification: Determines the conference domain (e.g., Environmental Science)

	Readability Metrics: Calculates word count, character count, readability score, and gives constructive feedback.

	Keyword Extraction: Identifies top keywords used and calculates their frequency as percentages.

You’ll see a generated analysis like:

3. Saving the Analysis
You’ll be asked:

	Do you want to save the analysis? (YES/NO)

	Filename: Provide a custom name (e.g. Academic Abstract)

	File Format: Choose between:
		"TEXT" — saves raw analysis as a .txt file

		"JSON" — saves structured data in .json format

Example Output Message: The Abstract Analysis is saved as a Json file Thank You!!!

Where It’s Stored:
Files are saved in the Abstract_Analyzer_files/ directory with the chosen filename and format.

Tips:
Ensure all fields are accurate before confirming.

Use the JSON format if you need structured data for downstream tools or dashboards.

Text format is great for quick human-readable exports.
